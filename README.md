# moody-hw6: Weather Dashboard

## Description
This app allows users to input a city and state to get both current weather and a 5-day forecast for the selected city. Users are presented with a colored background based on the severity of the UV Index. Green indicates low, yellow indicates moderate, red indicates high.

<br>
Upon completing a search, the city is saved so the user can reload the information for that city with a single click of a button.
